## Current Projects

Currently I'm interested in a number of things including:

- How does production and perception differ _within_ the same speaker: What strategies do speakers use to shift across cues?
- How can we model the interface between perception and production? Right now I am looking at **BiPhon** to see if we can use neural networks to figure out complexities in cue weighting and feature categories.
- The challenge of pitch tracking and improving methods: why some jumps are not errors!
